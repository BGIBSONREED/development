''' Loops and conditionals '''

'''
What is the difference between a For and While Loop?
How do I write a For Loop?
How do I write a While Loop?

'''
# For Loop
colors = ['green', 'blue', 'orange', 'yellow'] #you can solve taking username problem. you habe to look at the string the user is giving to you and you have loop through it

# for c in colors:
    # print(c)



# While Loop




''' Break Keyword '''

# Lets look at the 2 examples below and take note where the loop stops
# south = 10
# north = 5
# west = 6
# east = 11
# print(south)

# or south, north, west, east = 10, 5, 6, 11 (initialization variables on one line)
#print (south, north west, east)

# userin ='' #initialization of variable
# while userin != 'stop':
#     userin = input("Enter something orbit stop to leave the loop" )
#     print(userin)
 
# while True:
#     userin = input("Enter something orhit stop to leave the loop" )
#     if userin == 'stop':
#         break
#      print(userin)       




''' Break in nested loops '''

# i = 6
# while i> 0:
#     print(i)
#     i -= 1
#     if i == 4:
#         break

# else:
#     print('done')


# userin = ''
# #taking a string from the user until they hit stop

# while userin != 'stop': #(is not equal to )
#     userin = input("Please enter a word orbit stop to end the loop")

#     for l in userin: #looping through the input from the user
#         if l.isalpha(): # we are testing to  see if each chareacter is in the aplha bet
#             print(l)
#         else:
#             break
#     print("this is our next of line")
        

# while True:
#     userinput = input("Please enter your word")
#     print("we are online 77")
#     print(userinput)
#     print("we are still in the while loop")
#     break
#     print("I will not print, because we used the break keyword above me")

# # print("Why am I printed??") #this is outside of the loop



# '''
# Exercise

# Write some code that takes in numbers from a user one at a time. This should keep going until the user enters 0. Then print the sum of all the numbers.
# If the user inputs something that isn't a number, an error message should appear and the program should stop. (Hint: use break)

# Example (no error):
# 5
# 12
# 0
# Sum: 17

# Example (error):
# 5
# 7
# c
# Error: Not a number

# '''Declare any needed variables'''

# # '''Start our LookupError'''

# # '''Get our input'''

# ''' Continue keyword '''

''' Example
# Use the continue keyword to loop through a string and only print the vowels.

# # Sum of Even Digits

# # Take a string as user input, and verify that it's a number.

# Exercise

# Write some code that takes in strings from a user one at a time.
# After each string is taken in evaluate if the string is empty, a number, a set of letters, or contains symbols.
# If the string is empty, stop the loop.
# If the string is a number, convert it to a float and add it to a total.
# If the string is a set of letters, concatenate to the other letter strings passed in.
# If it contains a symbol, or is none of the above, do nothing and repeat the loop.
# Make sure to use break and/or continue.
